  I am a final year PhD candidate from the Computer Science department of Virginia Tech, USA. My primary area of research is software engineering. I use Python, and Java to conduct program analysis, domain-specific language creation, large language models (LLMs) tuning to enhance software maintenance by automatically detecting project configuration-related issues.
</p>

<p>
  I also have 3.5 years experience working as a full-stack software engineer. I worked on developing and enhancing web and desktop applications, and building a RESTful API-based backend from scratch using .NET Core, MS SQL Server, ASP.NET MVC, jQuery, etc. I was also an active participant of programming competitions such as - ACM ICPC Regionals, Codeforces rounds, Topcoder SRMs, etc. I used C++, and Java to solve complex algorithmic problems that required techniques such as - Graph Theory, Number Theory, Dynamic Programming, Data Structures, etc.
</p>

<p>
  My newest passion is integrating Large Language Model (LLM) with Domain-Specific Language to identify bug patterns in Java projects. My current expertise related to DSLs involves creating External DSLs by writing syntax rules, generating parsers, and developing durable engines that contains techniques such as caching and static analysis.
