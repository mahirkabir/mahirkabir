  I am a 4th Year Ph.D. student from the CS department of Virginia Tech, USA. My research topic is about helping software developers in maintaining project config files to reduce vulnerablities, and run-time bugs in NodeJS, and Spring projects.
</p>

<p>
  I am passionate about solving algorithmic problems using optimized code with better run-time & memory complexity, and writing easy-to-maintain, clean code by following proper design practices.
</p>

<p>
  My newest passion is creating easy-to-understand & optimized Domain Specific Languages for solving different domain specific problems. My current expertise related to DSLs involves creating External DSLs by writing syntax rules, generating parsers, and developing durable engines that contains techniques such as caching and static analysis.
